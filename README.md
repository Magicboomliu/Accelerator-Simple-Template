# Accelerator-Simple-Template

This an example of training the [Marigold Depth Estimation](https://huggingface.co/spaces/toshas/marigold) using accelerator using the sceneflow dataset. Since the original training code is not open source, only the inference pipeline is released, so the performance is not guaranteed.
